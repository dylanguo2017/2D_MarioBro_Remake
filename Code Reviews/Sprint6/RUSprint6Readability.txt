Specific comments on readibility: 
	Code is readable enough due to the well named variables. On top of variable names, control flow was also designed well enough so that the reader
    would know the program flow. However, since this is the class that is directly handling whether or not the program enters a normal or an infinite
    level, a difference in algorithm is used. Because I was largely in charge of the optimization and level loading of the normal level, I noticed that
    this class uses a different algorithm; one that is a bit confusing.
