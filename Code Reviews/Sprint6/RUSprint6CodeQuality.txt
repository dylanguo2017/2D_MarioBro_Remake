Specific comments on code quality: 
	The code has a high cohesion in some part; as it only focuses on updating the user input while on the
    start screen and drawing the start screen itself. However, codes such as counting the number of 
    pop up items is not cohesive and not necessary. It would be reccomended for it to be removed as the 
    normal Mario normal level does not need this variable, and it is believed that with modification, this
    variable is also not necessary for the infinite level. Other than cohesion, coupling is also a bit 
    tight as this class relies heavily on the game object that is passed to this class. However, this is
    a team design decision and it was deemed as one of the most convenient way to manipulate game data.
    Some changes need to be made to this class as this class still contain string literals. On top of that,
    there seems to be an empty if else block with unknown purpose; it would be best to remove it if it 
    is not necessary.
