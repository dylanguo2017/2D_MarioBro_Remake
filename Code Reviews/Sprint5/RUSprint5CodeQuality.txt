Specific comments on Code quality: 
	The cohesion in this class is good as this class only focuses on playing the background music while there is another
	class that handles sound effect such as jumping or bouncing. The Coupling for this class is also excellent as this 
	class does not depend on any other class. Even the sound resource loading processed here in the load method. This
	gives me an idea on how to improve the readability on the game class. All the texture 2d loading done in the game
	initialization classs could simply be done in a separate class for improved readablity. As for what could be improved
	on this class alone, I could not find any; just because all the necessary methods are already there with very high
	cohesion on each one of them.
