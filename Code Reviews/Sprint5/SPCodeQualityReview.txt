Specific comments on readibility: 
 The method names of Pause class are self-explanatory. Draw() draws the font "GAME IS PAUSED"
 while Update() plays the sound effects. The names of other class members such as 
 placeHol, delay, font1 and fontPos etc. are readeable enough but font1 can be renamed to 
 its font family to further increase readability. It is only dependent on game class so it has low number 
 of dependencies, low cohesion.
