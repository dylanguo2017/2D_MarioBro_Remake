Specific comments on code quality:
	The code has good cohesion because everything in the class, whether an item, pipe, enemy, or block does the same thing. The coupling is loose because this class doesn't know exactly what objects are in the lists it just knows to load them when they are in camera view. It is dependent on what goes on in the Game and Level class since it is updating objects based on what has been loaded. The code is maintainable because the name of the objects are easy to understand and set up for each type is the same. The reusability is good because if we add another list of objects we can follow the same code as the other objects to create the new ones.

Hypothetical change:
	We could separate this class into three other classes specific to the type so that way the length of the code in this class is lessened and the cohesion is even higher.
