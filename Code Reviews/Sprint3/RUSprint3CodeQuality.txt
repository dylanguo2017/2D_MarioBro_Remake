Specific comments on code quality: 
The code has a high cohesion in the sense that everything in the class file focuses on doing 1 thing; to detect with what 
object Mario is colliding with and specifically call the collision handler for that specific object. In terms of coupling,
 the class is a little bit loose as it directly accesses another class’s member field directly. However, readability has been 
improved from initial implementation as function names has been made more clear.
