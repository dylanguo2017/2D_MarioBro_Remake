Specific comments on readibility: 
MarioStateClass has low cohesion, in addition to the Mario states it also handles
Mario movement for up, down, left and right in their respective move methods.
The class has negligible number of dependencies and as such also has loose coupling. It
is not dependent on any other class or interface for its functionality. 

Hypothetical Change:
Create a separate class for handling Mario movement to increase cohesion.
