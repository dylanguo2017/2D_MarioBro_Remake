Comment:
high coupling was observed, the method CollisionDetection should only dealing with
returning type of collision, side of collision. CollisionDetection should not cope with
behavioral features of the objects involved which should be taken care of be collision handler outside
of collision detection class.

probably need to change the code of the collision detector soon.
