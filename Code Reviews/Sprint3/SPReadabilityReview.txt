Specific comments on readibility: 
This class has booleans facingleft, crouch, jump, move, up, down, left and right. The
enum marioStatus has values large, fire, small, dead and star. Other class members are xCoor, yCoor,
moveR, moveL, moveUp and moveDown. Most of the names are self-explanatory but some of them do not provide 
enough information such as what is the difference between boolean move vs booleans up/down/left/right or the 
difference between boolean move vs methods moveL/moveR/moveUp/moveDown etc.
