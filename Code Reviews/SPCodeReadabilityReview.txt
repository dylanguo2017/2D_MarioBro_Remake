Comments on readibility: 
	The code is fairly readable. Names are well-defined, cohesive and do not require
	any additional comments.
Comments on code quality:
	The code is redundant. Many other classes (including mine, i.e. Item.cs) use the 
	same class variables and methods and it would be more efficient to create a base 
	class containing all the duplicate code (for this sprint only).
Hypothetical change:
	Create a base class containing all the duplicate code.
