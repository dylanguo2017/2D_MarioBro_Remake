Code Quality:

For Draw() method, there are too many if-else statements which reduced the readability
and increased the difficulty to maintain the code.

For the constructor LargeMario, it takes too many parameters, which increased the dependency of the code, and also a better
practice of using the sprite sheets would be using one or two sprite sheets which contains all different types of marios,instead
of using so many sprite sheets for each of the mario state.

The team still need to figure out a better way to manipulate one single sprite sheet with all types of marios, until then, the 
team will stick with the current technique.
