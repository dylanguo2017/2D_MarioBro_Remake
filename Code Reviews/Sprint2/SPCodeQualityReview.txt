Comments on code quality:
	Enemy class has high cohesion and loose coupling. It only has two methods draw and update
	which supports a central purpose and contain strongly related functionality. It also has 
	a low number of class dependencies as it is only dependent on Texture2D and SpriteBatch classes for
	its functionality. However, the code is not very re-usable for future sprints as having one enemy
	class for all enemies (Goomba, Koopa etc.) will not be sufficient.
Hypothetical change:
	Create separate enemy classes (just like separate block and mario classes in this sprint) 
	for each enemy type (for future sprints).
