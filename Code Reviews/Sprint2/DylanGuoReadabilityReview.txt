Sprint 2
File name: Item.cs & Game1.cs
minutes reviewed: 10min
readability:

For Item.cs file:
Local variables like xLoc , yLoc clearly indicates the 2 dimensions of the vector's value.

For Game1.cs file:
The ArrayList ItemList was used to store all item objects, which is a good way to simplify the code.
A for each loop was used to draw different type of items, which is a good way to shorten the code.

For Game1.cs file:
Too many sprite sheets for mario were loaded, a better practice would be only importing one big sprite sheet that 
includes all types of marios.
The change might be made soon, since the current draw() method in different mario classes still requies parameters which
are related to these sprite sheets.
