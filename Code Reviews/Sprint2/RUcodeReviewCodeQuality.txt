Specific comments on code quality:
	code is very efficient in the update method as the questionmark block can only 
	change into a used block. However, the code is not very re-useable as it only
	spawns the block in a single specific location. Overall, this code has high
	cohesion as each method has a very specific purpose and all the code inside
	the method only focuses on doing that. Coupling is also a bit low as the code
	does not use any global variable or call any other class's method. the only 
	thing that causes coupling to be a bit tighter is the parameter passing that
	the constructor and draw method takes.

hypothetical change:
	make the draw method take a vector parameter so that block summoning is not 
	pre-determined such as in this method.
