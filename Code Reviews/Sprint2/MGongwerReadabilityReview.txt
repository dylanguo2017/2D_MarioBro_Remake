The code is pretty readable. Knowing the different frames involved, x or y coordinates, width and height of a sprite, and state 
are very easy to understand. The flow is consistent and easy to follow as everything for the right is done first and then the left.
A readability issue arrises with a new developer not knowing right away what fireMarioId, fireMarioLM, 
fireMarioLJ, fireMarioLC, fireMarioRM, fireMarioRJ, and fireMarioRC are if you are not familiar with the game. Id stands for idle.
LM stands for left move and so on. Once you know one it's fairly easy to assume but initially they may just seem like odd labels.

The code quality is good and not much can be done, that I know of, to reduce the code length. It is very easy to follow.

Hypothetical change:
	Define desitination rectangle before the if/else statments sinces several use the same one.
