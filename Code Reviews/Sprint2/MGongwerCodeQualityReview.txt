The code quality is strong with cohesion and coupling. Everything within FireMario is related to specifically what mario does in his fire state. Everything serves to change the state of fire mario. Coupling is kind of tight as the parameters passed to the constructor method are dependent on the Game class. The code is maintainable because the names of the objects are easy to understand and it is easy to add or take away functions like move, jump and crouch. The reusability is also fairly high as the functions for fire mario are similar to large mario so following the same outline makes it easier to add more states.

Hypothetical change:
	Utilizing switch/case instead of if/else to organize the code better.
