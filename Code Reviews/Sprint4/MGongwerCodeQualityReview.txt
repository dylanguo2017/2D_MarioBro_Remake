The code has high cohesion because only enemies colliding with blocks/pipes occur. The enemies are pulled in through a list and so are the blocks.The code also has pretty loose coupling. everything is pretty vague and changing things in this class doesn't cause issues elsewhere. However there is a hardcoded number that shouldn't be that way. The code is maintainable because we could add different colliding types easily. The reusability is also fairly high because it works for any enemy we create.

Hypothetical change:
	Make a numbers class that houses all of our hard coded numbers and use for that. It is referencing the size of the 
screen so it is a number used elsewhere in the project so having one source for it would be best in case we were to change the screen width later on.
