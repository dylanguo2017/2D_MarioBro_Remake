Specific comments on readibility: 
	Cohesion is high in this class as this class only focuses on getting the offset of other
	objects to be drawn. However, since the camera is relative to mario, this class calls
	MarioStateClass's data directly; making coupling a bit tight. On top of that, the update
	method is never used and is empty. It is recommended for future implementation to remove
	the unused method, or to utilize it somehow.
