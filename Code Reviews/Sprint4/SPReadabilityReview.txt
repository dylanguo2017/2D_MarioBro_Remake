Specific comments on readability: 
	The physics class has high readability. Its member names are self-explanatory 
	i.e. xCoor, yCoor, xVel, yVel, yAcc, falling, Update() and DontFall().
	The physics class can also be used for any game object by simply creating its new 
	instance with the said object's x & y coors so it has loose coupling.
