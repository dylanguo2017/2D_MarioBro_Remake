	The methods inside this collision handler contains star handler, mushroom handler and a general HandleCollision.
	these methods handle all the relavent and possible collisions that will happen between items and blocks and other items.
	mostly the code is in good condition, further improvement can be made regarding separating this class into several indivisual classes.
