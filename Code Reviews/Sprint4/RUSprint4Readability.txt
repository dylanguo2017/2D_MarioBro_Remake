Specific comments on readibility: 
	The code is very readable as it is very short and concise. Therefore, it also has a high 
	cohesion. All the variable names are right on point and could be understood instantly.
	The logic behind control flow also makes sense although it takes quite a bit of time to 
	understand for such a short method.
