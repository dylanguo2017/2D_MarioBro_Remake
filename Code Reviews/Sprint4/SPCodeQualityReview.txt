Specific comments on readability: 
	Physics class is not dependent on any other class or interface for its 
	functionality so it has low number of dependencies. It has high cohesion as 
	it only deals with an object's x & y coor and their velocities & acclerations.
	Since it has low number of dependencies, it also has loose coupling. The names
	of the class members are also self-explanatory.
