Our team discussed that the burndown chart for this sprint wasn't the best. We had a large plateau at the beginning. We also had A LOT of refactoring to do so a ton of work was done in the last few days. The tasks were split up enough to allow us to show more things getting completed but some larger items like camera and physics took a while to finish. We need to do more work in the beginning to even our work load and show more improvement in our burndown chart. 

Our team believes that things went well during this sprint for the circumstances. Having to refactor a lot stressed us all out and we would get frustrated. We really need to work on communicating if something is unable to be finished by when expected. We have started to do skype sessions which work really well when we hit areas of confusion. Overall we could still improve on doing an even amount of work throughout.
