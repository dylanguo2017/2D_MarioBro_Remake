Our team discussed that the burndown chart for this sprint is not ideal. There is a pretty steep 
increase where the work was started, which wasn't until two days after the start of the 
sprint. While the in progress and completion rate was gradual, there were a few areas of plateauing
that means our team created very broad tasks that took a while to complete, or we were not working
steadily every day. We believe that our time and project management could
be improved by creating smaller tasks rather than single, broad ones. 

Our team believes that things went well for our first major group sprint. What worked was everyone being
active in creating, editing and committing their code in a timely manner for someone else to look
at and fix or use. Everyone pulled their weight. We also each carry our unique strengths that helps make
decisions quicker and code quality stronger. Overall we could improve on (1) not waiting too long to start one of
the harder classes or tasks and (2) increasing effective communication to make sure that everyone understands what is 
going on and why we decided to do what we did.
