Our team discussed that the burndown chart for this sprint is better than Sprint 2, but still has some rough patches. The time it took to start the tasks was slow but we created more specific tasks that allowed for a better decline in completion rate. However, there are a couple sections with long plateaus where no tasks changed progress time or got completed. There was also a few tasks that were finished up on the last two days that caused a bit of a rush. 

Our team believes that things went better during this sprint. We had a few discussions at the beginning on how to do things and were able to come to one final decision. That is one of our strengths as a team. We may disagree at first but everyone listens to each other's ideas and we decide what is best for the project. Also, everyone is quick to help each other out if they get stuck. Overall we could still improve on (1) not waiting too long to start tasks and (2) communicating the class we are working on so no one does duplicate work, leading to someone's code being discarded.
