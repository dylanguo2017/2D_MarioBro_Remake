Our team discussed that the burndown chart for this sprint should have been good but it was worse than any of the others. We had a lot of plateaus and most of the work was finished during refactoring. We need to do more work in the beginning to even our work load and show more improvement in our burndown chart. 

Our team believes that things went well during this sprint for the circumstances. Having to pick up some slack and refactor a lot made us frantic. We did communicate and work together really well the last two days with helping each other get code working. We really need to work on communicating if something is unable to finish what they are supposed to and when expected. We have continued to do skype sessions which work really well when we hit areas of confusion. Overall we could still improve on starting work earlier and consitently working on things.
